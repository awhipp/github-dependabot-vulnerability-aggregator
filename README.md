# Grab Pull Requests that were deployed by dependabot from GitHub SDK

NOTE: 
* This only pulls the vulnerabilities that dependabot has open pull requests for 
* GitHub does not currently have an API to get dependabot vulnerabilities and therefore these cannot be pulled dynamically at this time.

## Install the depdendencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Add environment variables

Copy `example.env` to `.env`
* Update `GIT_TOKEN` with your Personal Access Token (read:repo permissions)
* Update `ORGANIZATION` with the organization in question
* Update `ENTERPRISE_URL` with the enterprise url

## Execute the application

`python app.py`
